## Project description

Welcome to the HH webstite. A *self-learning* project run by some geeky
microbiologist in which we aim to understand HTML, CSS, and Jekyll (a
static site generator written in ruby) at a sufficient level to be able
to create and maintain a site for succesful collaborations within the
microbiology department. The [hh-nuig](https://nuighackyhour.github.io/
"hh-nuig webpage") webpage will contain blog posts, documentation, and
tutorials useful for the people in microbiology NUIG.

We aim to develop a usable and complete site by <2019-04-30 Tue>.

## Collaboration

Being learning the objective of this project any form of constructive
collaboration (e.g., improvements for syntax, structure, suggestions for
resources, etc.) is welcomed.

For an introduction to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the theme here in
use ([Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)) and our
implementation of these tools to build this web site, head over our 
[collaboration guide](https://nuighackyhour.github.io/how-to-collaborate).
