## Project description
This is a *self-learning* project in which I aim to understand HTML, CSS, and
Jekyll (a static site generator written in ruby) at a sufficient level to be
able to create and maintain a personal blog and the
[hh-nuig](https://nuighackyhour.github.io/ "hh-nuig webpage") webpage
(containing blog posts, documentation, and tutorial).

I will dedicate a maximum of 10 hours a week to this project and I aim to have
the following tasks completed by <2019-04-30 Tue>.

## Collaboration
Being learning the objective of this project any form of constructive
collaboration (e.g., improvements for syntax, structure, suggestions for
resources, etc.) is welcomed.
