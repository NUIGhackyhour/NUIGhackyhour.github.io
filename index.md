## Project description
Welcome to the HH webstite. A *self-learning* project run by some geeky
microbiologist in which we aim to understand HTML, CSS, and Jekyll
(a static site generator written in ruby) at a sufficient level to be
able to create and maintain a site for succesful collaborations within the
microbiology department. The
[hh-nuig](https://nuighackyhour.github.io/ "hh-nuig webpage") webpage
will contain blog posts, documentation, and tutorials useful for the people
 in microbiology NUIG.

We aim to develop a usable and complete site by <2019-04-30 Tue>.

## Collaboration
Being learning the objective of this project any form of constructive
collaboration (e.g., improvements for syntax, structure, suggestions for
resources, etc.) is welcomed.
