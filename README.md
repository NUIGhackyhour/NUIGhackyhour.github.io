## Project description

We are the Bioinformatic Section of the Microbiology Society
([MicroSoc](https://socs.nuigalway.ie/societies.php?id=NjI=)) at NUI Galway
(Ireland) and this is our website build. Our section is composed by:

* [Carlos Sanchez](mailto:c.sanchez2@nuigalway.ie) - Web and devices
* [Marco Prevedello](mailto:m.prevedello1@nuigalway.ie) - Amplicon sequencing
  and web
* [Nick Waters](mailto:n.waters4@nuigalway.ie) - WGS and data analysis
* [Peyman Sadrimajd](mailto:p.sadrimajd1@nuigalway.ie) - Machine Learning
* [Theo Trabac](mailto:t.trabac1@nuigalway.ie) - Amplicon sequencing

We aim to implement and share open, standardized, opinionated statistical and
bioinformatic methods developed at the Department of Microbiology (NUI Galway,
Ireland). [**This**](https://github.com/NUIGhackyhour/NUIGhackyhour.github.io)
is our develop version of the website. The official website for MicroSoc,
including all the goodies we are working on here, will be soon deployed. So,
**stay tuned!!**

## Collaboration

We ain't expert web developers, we ain't expert statisticians or
bioinformaticians, but we are PhD students aiming to get better and share our
learning process. Hence, any form of constructive suggestion is more than
welcomed.

To get started fork this repository and send us a pull request! :+1: We will
respond in no time :boom:

If you want to give us direct suggestion do not hesitate and hits us up at
[email address](mailto:hh-nuig@googlegroup.com).

If you need a hand to get around our coding choices or with the Jekyll
framework, head to the [Getting Started](404) guide.
